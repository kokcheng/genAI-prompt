| A hyperrealistic 3D digital artwork of a man running out of a giant smartphone screen. The phone displays a Facebook profile page exactly as shown in the screenshot (with profile photo, cover photo and text visible). The display effect is a realistic water mosaic, as if the phone screen is made of wavy water. When stepping out, the water splashes dynamically around her legs and the ground, creating a sensation of movement. The man is wearing a white hoodie, blue shorts, Salomon slippers and headphones around his neck. The background is minimalist and gray, which allows the effects of water and Facebook profile screen to stand out considerably| <img src="images/sample1.png" alt="Japanese Garden" width="300"/> |
